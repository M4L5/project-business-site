# Business Site

Week 3 of Technigos Bootcamp where we were to learn:

-How the internet works
-How to use HTML forms and simple requests
-What Javascript is and what it's used for
-How to modify the DOM using Javascript

## The problem

I had issues with understanding JavaScript and how to style the different parts. Mostly on how to use flexbox for the user input in the form.
